# Building a Finance-Focused Language Model with Chain of Thought Reasoning

The intersection of artificial intelligence and personal finance presents unique opportunities for creating more accessible financial guidance. Recently, I explored how Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning principles could enhance a language model's ability to provide structured financial advice, specifically tailored to the Kenyan market context.

## Background and Motivation

The CoT-Self-Instruct methodology, introduced by Meta FAIR researchers in their paper ["CoT-Self-Instruct: Building High-Quality Synthetic Prompts for Reasoning and Non-Reasoning Tasks"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23751), demonstrates how self-generated, high-quality prompts rooted in step-by-step reasoning can outperform traditional instruction datasets. This approach particularly excels when models need to explain their reasoning process rather than simply providing answers.

Personal finance decisions often require careful consideration of multiple factors such as risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and investment timelines. The CoT approach seemed like a natural fit for this domain, where the reasoning process is just as important as the final recommendation.

## Implementation Approach

### Dataset Creation

I began by manually curating a seed dataset containing 111 examples of reasoning-focused financial instructions. Each example followed the CoT pattern of "Let's think step by step," ensuring comprehensive coverage of common financial scenarios in the Kenyan context.

Here's an example from the dataset:

```json
{
  "instruction": "What should I consider when choosing between a fixed deposit and a money market fund?",
  "input": "",
  "output": "Let's think step by step.\n\n1. Fixed deposits offer guaranteed returns but lock your money for a set period.\n2. Money market funds offer liquidity and slightly higher returns, but the returns are not guaranteed.\n3. If you prioritize safety and can wait, fixed deposits may suit you.\n4. If you want flexibility and access to funds, go for money market funds.\n\nTherefore, your decision should depend on your risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and expected return."
}
```

### Model Architecture and Training

For this experiment, I used DistilGPT2 as the base model, applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for efficient fine-tuning. The choice of DistilGPT2 provided a good balance between performance and computational efficiency, while LoRA enabled parameter-efficient training with only 0.49% of parameters being trainable.

The LoRA configuration targeted the attention layers with rank 8 and alpha 16:

```python
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,
    lora_alpha=16,
    target_modules=["c_attn", "c_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.05,
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)
```

### Training Process

The training process involved:
1. Converting the manually curated dataset into the appropriate format
2. Tokenizing with a maximum length of 512 tokens
3. Training for 3 epochs with careful monitoring of loss reduction
4. Saving both the fine-tuned model and tokenizer

The training loss showed consistent improvement from 4.32 to 3.26 over 297 steps, indicating effective learning of the CoT reasoning patterns.

## Key Findings

The fine-tuned model demonstrated several improvements over the base model:

1. **Structured Reasoning**: Responses consistently followed the "Let's think step by step" format, breaking down complex financial decisions into digestible components.

2. **Context Awareness**: The model showed understanding of Kenyan financial instruments and market conditions, providing relevant advice for the local context.

3. **Logical Flow**: Financial recommendations followed clear logical progressions, considering multiple factors before reaching conclusions.

## Technical Implementation

The complete implementation is available in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Okoth67/distilgpt2-lora-finetune-wekeza-v5-cot), including the training notebook, dataset, and model artifacts. The repository demonstrates:

- Data preprocessing and formatting techniques
- LoRA configuration for efficient fine-tuning
- Training pipeline with appropriate hyperparameters
- Model evaluation and inference examples

## Validation of CoT Principles

This project validates several key findings from the original CoT-Self-Instruct research:

1. **Quality over Quantity**: Starting with high-quality seed examples (111 carefully crafted instances) proved more effective than using larger, less curated datasets.

2. **Reasoning Enhancement**: The step-by-step approach significantly improved the coherence and helpfulness of financial advice.

3. **Domain Adaptability**: CoT principles successfully transferred to specialized domains like personal finance, maintaining effectiveness even in localized contexts.

## Future Directions

This implementation opens several avenues for future development:

- **Expanded Dataset**: Growing the seed dataset with more diverse financial scenarios
- **Multi-language Support**: Extending to local languages for broader accessibility
- **Integration Capabilities**: Developing APIs for integration with financial applications
- **Performance Optimization**: Exploring larger base models and advanced fine-tuning techniques

## Conclusion

The successful application of CoT-Self-Instruct principles to Kenyan finance data demonstrates the versatility and effectiveness of reasoning-based training approaches. By teaching language models to think through problems step by step, we can create more transparent, helpful, and trustworthy AI systems.

This experiment not only validates the theoretical framework presented in the original research but also provides a practical blueprint for applying advanced NLP techniques to real-world domains. The combination of careful dataset curation, efficient training methods, and domain-specific knowledge creates a foundation for developing more capable and reliable AI assistants.

The complete code, dataset, and trained model are available for exploration and further development, contributing to the growing body of work on practical applications of Chain of Thought reasoning in language models.
