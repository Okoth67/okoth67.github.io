# My LLM Learning Diary

I'm a self-taught NLP/LLM student, learning by building and working on hands-on projects.  
This blog is my digital journal, a space to document what I’m working on, learning and how I’m growing.  

I'll be sharing updates, lessons and thoughts as I go.  
Follow along if you're into LLMs, fine-tuning, or just curious about the journey.
